Introduction
-----------------------------
  Gridy adds an invisible grid to Windows, so that any window you move 
  or resize is snapped to it.
  Snapping is enabled with mouse drag or keyboard arrow keys.
  
  Gridy also lets you store and restore a window's size and position 
  in up to 12 slots. This is useful for quickly arranging your windows 
  in a convenient way.
  
  In addition, you can apply these changes to any window or dialog:
  - Make any window semi-transparent
  - Hide the window's Alt-Tab icon
  - Set any window to be Always on Top
  - Resize any window to a predefined size of your choice
  - Minimize all windows but the active one


Getting Started
-----------------------------
  After starting Gridy, right click its icon in the system tray to 
  access some configuration options.
  You may also double click the system tray to see the Help screen 
  with all of the available actions.
  
  For example, while a restored window (not maximized) is in focus, 
  press and hold the Win key and press the arrow keys to move the 
  window in fixed intervals.
  The same snapping effect can also be achieved by simply moving or 
  resizing the window.


Technical Notes
-----------------------------
  Gridy is built as a single executable + a configuration file.
  The configuration file is a simple INI file that can be edited 
  either manually or by using the system tray menu.
  
  Gridy does not write anything to the registry and is completely 
  portable.

             (configurable)

    Changed: new Help dialog
  
  2006 08 11 - 0.22
    Added  : menu items to change some INI settings

  2006 08 09 - 0.21
    Fixed  : when starting to move another window, shadow first showed 
             itself for a quick second, with the size of the previously 
             snapped window. Fixed by first placing the shadow at the right
             place and only then "untransparenting" it

  2006 08 09 - 0.20
    Changed: improved performance when shadow is enabled. now when the 
             frame is created, it is never "hidden", instead, it is being
             resized to a 1x1 pixel on the top left of the screen, and then 
             set to full transparency. in order to accomplish this, the 
             alt-tab icon of the frame was removed using ExStyle 0x80.
             in addition, some seemingly ineffective lines were removed from
             the ShowFrame and HideFrame routines. Another, more minor 
             change was done in the main WatchCursor timer.
    Fixed  : shadowtype Shadow is now also transparent. This was fixed by 
             accident, probably to a better use of the transparency settings
             and the fact that we do not hide and show the window all the 
             time

  2006 08 08 - 0.19
    Fixed  : version 0.18 broke the Solid frametype action - solid shadow
             got stuck. This was fixed by changing the way by which we
             check if we have a menu, by simply checking if the window we
             attempt to "shadow" still exists. Menus, do not exist after
             they are clicked.
    Changed: startup and exit tooltips are now shorter
    Added  : first attempt to reduce timer performance - added SetBatchLines
     

  2006 08 08 - 0.18
    Fixed  : shadow frame and tooltip were created when clicking menus.
             fixed by checking if the window id has changed since we first
             clicked the mouse.

  2006 08 07 - 0.17
    Fixed  : shadow frame now does not have a task bar icon. fixed with 
             +OWNER attribute
    Added  : abother shadow type - Shadow. This style currently does not
             support transparency for some reason. Need to check if this
             is by design, or by bug.

  2006 08 07 - 0.16
    Added  : shadow border when moving/resizing windows. configurable 
             through INI.

  2006 08 06 - 0.15
    Fixed  : non resizable windows used to be moved to grid when certain 
             controls were selected. this was fixed by capturing the control
             under the mouse upon click, and if there is any control, we do
             not move.
    Added  : exit traytip

  2006 08 06 - 0.14
    Fixed  : changed the execution order of the main routine. It should fix 
             the bugs where non resizable windows are resized, and the bug
             where windows used to move with only a mouse-over.
  
  2006 08 06 - 0.13
    Fixed  : when a window first loaded, it used to snap even without the 
             user moving it. had a missing Return in startup routine.
    Fixed  : now ignoring maximized windows, or windows that are just being
             maximized.
  
  2006 08 05 - 0.12
    Added  : new key in INI - DisableKey. pressing this key when dragging
             will move the window freely, without any snapping.

  2006 08 05 - 0.11
    Fixed  : (hopefully) now ignoring non-resizable windows
    Added  : key in INI file to set the non-resizable window handling
  
  2006 08 05 - 0.10
    First version
